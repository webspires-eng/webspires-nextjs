The fee depends on ad spend, campaign types, and complexity. Ad spend is separate and paid directly to Google, with no markup from us.' },
            { q: 'What is the difference between the management fee and my ad budget?', a: 'The management fee pays our team to build, run, and optimise your campaigns. The ad budget is the money Google charges for clicks and impressions. They are separate, the budget goes straight to Google, and we never add a markup to it.' },
            { q: 'Is there a minimum ad spend?', a: 'No fixed minimum, though paid search needs enough budget to gather data and compete in the auction. For most UK small businesses, a starting budget of a few hundred pounds a month gives campaigns room to prove themselves. We recommend a realistic figure after the audit.' },
            { q: 'Am I tied into a long contract?', a: 'No. Management runs on rolling monthly terms with no long lock-in. You own your Google Ads account and data throughout, so you keep everything and leave whenever you choose. We hold onto clients by performing, not by contracts.' },
            { q: 'How long until I see results?', a: 'Search campaigns often generate enquiries within days of launch, then improve as the account gathers data and gets optimised over the following weeks. In 2026, with more automation in play, the first few weeks of tight tracking and refinement matter more than ever for a low cost per enquiry.' },
            { q: 'Do I own my account and data?', a: 'Yes. We set up and run the campaigns inside an account you own, so the history, data, and assets stay with you. If you ever leave, you take the account intact. No agency holds your account hostage.' },
            { q: 'Should I hire an agency, a freelancer, or run it in-house?', a: 'A freelancer suits light, low-budget accounts, an in-house hire suits high-spend brands with the volume to justify a salary, and an agency suits businesses that want senior expertise and proper tracking without hiring. We give an honest steer during the audit, even when the answer is not us.' },
            { q: 'Is PPC better than SEO?', a: 'Neither wins outright, because they do different jobs. Paid search captures demand fast and gives full control over budget and targeting, while organic search compounds value over time. Most businesses need both, and we run paid search here while handling SEO under the same roof.' },

            { q: 'What is generative engine optimisation (GEO)?', a: 'Generative engine optimisation is the work of getting your brand cited and recommended inside AI-generated answers from engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. Rather than ranking a link, GEO makes your business the source the AI quotes when a buyer asks a question.' },
            { q: 'What is the difference between GEO, AEO, and SEO?', a: 'SEO earns rankings and clicks on the classic results page. GEO and AEO earn citations and recommendations inside AI answers, with AEO framed around answering the question directly. They share a technical foundation, which is why GEO works best grounded in strong SEO rather than bolted on.' },
            { q: 'Will GEO replace SEO?', a: 'No. AI answers and classic results sit side by side, and most businesses need both. Strong SEO foundations make GEO faster and more durable, while GEO extends your reach into the AI surfaces where a growing share of questions now end. We run them together.' },
            { q: 'How do you measure AI visibility?', a: 'We track a defined set of your core buyer queries across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and Google AI Overviews, then report whether your brand is cited and whether it is recommended. A citation is not a recommendation, so we measure both, and we never pass off Search Console impressions as AI visibility.' },
            { q: 'How do you check if my brand appears in ChatGPT or Perplexity?', a: 'We run your real buyer questions through each engine, record whether your brand is named and how accurately, and benchmark against competitors. That becomes a tracked query set we monitor over time, so you see movement rather than a one-off snapshot.' },
            { q: 'How long does GEO take to work?', a: 'Early wins like corrected facts and schema inclusion often land within weeks, while stronger citation and recommendation presence builds over a few months. In 2026 the engines update constantly, so GEO is an ongoing discipline rather than a one-off fix, much like SEO.' },
            { q: 'Is GEO worth it for a small or local business?', a: 'Yes, and most agencies miss this. Customers now ask AI for the best option near them and the best provider in their town, and almost no one optimises for it. A focused GEO and AEO programme suits SMEs that want to be found where buyers increasingly ask, without an enterprise budget.' },
            { q: 'How much does GEO cost in the UK?', a: 'UK GEO retainers typically run from around £600 per month for a foundation programme to £2,500 and above for competitive markets and full-footprint work. Price depends on your starting visibility, your market, and the depth of content and authority work. We confirm scope after a free audit, on rolling monthly terms.' },

            { q: 'How much does Meta ads management cost in the UK?', a: 'UK Meta ads management fees typically run from around £600 per month for smaller accounts to £2,500 and above for higher-spend management, plus a one-off setup from £750. The fee depends on ad spend, creative volume, and complexity. Ad spend is separate and paid directly to Meta, with no markup from us.' },
            { q: 'What is the difference between the management fee and my ad budget?', a: 'The management fee pays our team to plan, build, test, and optimise your campaigns. The ad budget is the money Meta charges to show your ads. They are separate, the budget goes straight to Meta, and we never add a markup to it.' },
            { q: 'Is there a minimum ad spend?', a: 'No fixed minimum, though paid social needs enough budget to exit the learning phase and test creative properly. For most UK small businesses, a starting budget from a few hundred pounds a month upward gives campaigns room to prove themselves. We recommend a realistic figure after the audit.' },
            { q: 'Am I tied into a long contract?', a: 'No. Management runs on rolling monthly terms with no long lock-in. You own your Meta ad account, Pixel, and data throughout, so you keep everything and leave whenever you choose. We hold onto clients by performing, not by contracts.' },
            { q: 'How long until I see results?', a: 'Many accounts see early conversions within the first few weeks as campaigns exit the learning phase, then improve as creative testing and optimisation compound. Paid social rewards patience with creative, so the first month is about gathering data and finding the angles that convert.' },
            { q: 'Do I own my account and data?', a: 'Yes. We set up and run campaigns inside an ad account you own, so the Pixel, audiences, and history stay with you. If you ever leave, you take the account intact. No agency holds your account hostage.' },
            { q: 'Should I run Facebook ads, Instagram ads, or both?', a: 'Usually both. Meta serves your ads across Facebook and Instagram from one campaign, and the platform finds the cheapest conversions across placements. We set the split by where your buyers respond, rather than guessing up front, and let the data decide.' },
            { q: 'Is Meta better than Google Ads?', a: 'Neither wins outright. Meta creates demand by putting your offer in front of the right audience, while Google captures demand from people already searching. Most businesses grow fastest running both, which is why we handle Meta and Google Ads under one roof.' },
            { q: 'Will Meta ads still work in 2026, and what is the new UK location fee?', a: 'Yes, Meta ads remain one of the strongest channels for sales and leads in 2026. From July 2026, Meta applies a UK location fee of 2 to 5 percent on ad delivery, a pass-through cost charged by Meta on top of your budget, not by us. We factor it into planning so your targets stay realistic.' },

            '"Near me" now happens in two places: the Google local pack and AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews, which increasingly recommend local businesses directly. Most local agencies optimise only the first. We optimise both, through entity-rich profiles, consistent structured data, and the citation-worthy local authority that AI engines pull from. The result is simple: your business gets recommended whether the customer opens Google Maps or asks an assistant for a local option.',

        faqHeading: 'Local SEO FAQs',
        faqs: [
            { q: 'How much does local SEO cost in the UK?', a: 'UK local SEO retainers typically run from around £400 per month for a single location to £1,200 and above for multi-location or competitive markets. The price depends on your area, competition, and the number of profiles. We confirm scope after a free audit, with rolling monthly terms and no lock-in.' },
            { q: 'How long does local SEO take?', a: 'Profile and citation fixes often show within weeks, while stronger local pack positions build over three to six months. Local SEO compounds, so the longer the foundations run, the harder they are for competitors to dislodge. We track progress on a geo-grid so you see movement early.' },
            { q: 'What is included, and what is Google Business Profile optimisation?', a: 'Local SEO covers your Google Business Profile, reviews, citations, local content, local links, and structured data. Profile optimisation means completing and tuning your categories, services, attributes, posts, photos, and Q&A, so the profile ranks and converts searchers into calls and visits.' },
            { q: 'Do you guarantee a local pack ranking?', a: 'No, and anyone who does is a red flag. No agency controls Google’s local algorithm. We commit to the work that earns rankings, profile optimisation, reviews, citations, and authority, then report progress honestly on a geo-grid rather than promising a position no agency controls.' },
            { q: 'How does "near me" work in AI search now?', a: 'In 2026, customers increasingly ask ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews for local recommendations, and those engines name specific businesses. We optimise your entity data, structured data, and local authority so AI assistants recommend you, not just the map pack.' },
            { q: 'Why does NAP consistency matter?', a: 'NAP stands for name, address, and phone. When these differ across directories, Google loses confidence in which details are correct, and your local rankings suffer. Consistent citations across the web remove that doubt and strengthen the prominence signal the local pack rewards.' },
            { q: 'Do you handle multiple locations?', a: 'Yes. Each site gets its own optimised Google Business Profile and location page, managed consistently so they reinforce rather than compete with each other. Multi-location local SEO scales the same framework across every area, with geo-grid tracking for each one.' },
            { q: 'What is the difference between local SEO and national SEO?', a: 'Local SEO targets the map pack and "near me" searches for customers near your location. National SEO targets organic rankings across the whole UK, regardless of where the searcher sits. Most local businesses start local, then expand into national SEO as they grow, and we run both.' },
